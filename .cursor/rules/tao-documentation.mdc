# TAO Documentation Protocol

## **MANDATORY: Thought, Action, Observation Documentation**

It is critical to track all of the actions, thought process and observations made when generating or modifying code. You will need to create a TAO file for each step of each SPEC file you read in.

### TAO File Creation Requirements
- **MUST** create corresponding `TAO-X.md` file after completing each `SPEC-X.md` task
- TAO files document **Thoughts, Actions, and Observations** chronologically
- Place TAO files in same directory as the `SPEC-X.md` file
- Each TAO file serves as a complete log of the implementation process. I do mean COMPLETE!
- After all of the steps have been documented and written, create a new section that is a concise summary of all actions taken, similar to the overview displayed in the agent summary

### Required TAO Format (EXACT FORMAT REQUIRED)
```markdown
### Step [Step Number]
#### Thought
[Your internal reasoning here. Explain why you're taking this step, what you're trying to achieve, and what tools or files you plan to use. Be concise but thorough]

#### Action
[The specific action you're taking. Be concise and use clear format: Tool: [Tool Name], File: [File Name], or Command: [Terminal Command]. List files modified/created/deleted]

#### Observation
[The result of your action. Tool output, file content, or command result. This data will inform your next thought.]
```

### TAO Documentation Rules
- Document EVERY step in the TAO format
- Be thorough and transparent in documentation
- **Do NOT proceed to next step until current Observation is fully processed**
- Each step must have complete Thought → Action → Observation cycle
- **IMPORTANT**: when handling ad-hoc prompts from the user, you MUST also update the latest TAO-X.md file with the same updates you would for processing a SPEC file
- Final output should include completed TAO file and modified code files

### TAO Process Guidelines
- Use sequential step numbering (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- Each Thought should explain the reasoning behind the action
- Each Action should clearly state what is being done and to which files
- Each Observation should capture the complete result/output
- Use the observation data to inform the next thought process

### TAO Quality Standards
- Be concise but thorough in explanations
- Include specific file names and tool names in actions
- Capture complete output in observations (don't truncate important details)
- Maintain chronological order throughout the process
- End each TAO file with a summary of what was accomplished
